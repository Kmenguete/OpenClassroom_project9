### 1. About the application
***
The application is a django web application that let the user publish or
ask for a review for a specific book. This application is an MVP. Because 
the application is an MVP, I voluntarily kept the style simple and minimal.
When a user creates an account, he/she has the possibility to follow other 
users. When a user follows another user, he/she is able to see reviews and
tickets of this followed user. When a user wish to ask for a review, he/she 
creates a ticket. When a ticket has been created by a user, this ticket can 
receive a review. If a ticket has already received a review, this ticket is 
no longer available. Users haves also the possibility to post a review not in response to a 
ticket. When a user posts a review or a ticket, he/she is able to update 
his/her own tickets/reviews as many times as they want.
